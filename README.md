The challenge was to build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Created an interactive dashboard that displays a bar plot, bubble and gauge plot as well as demogrpahic information of any Test Subject ID that the user selects.
